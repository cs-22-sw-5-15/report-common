ECDAR (\textbf{E}nvironment for \textbf{C}ompositional \textbf{D}esign and \textbf{A}nalysis of \textbf{R}eal Time Systems.)
 is a tool for model checking \cite{ecdartheory} which is a form of computer aided varification \cite{modelchecking_handbook}.
Systems nowadays are big and complex and consists of multiple components designed by independent teams \cite{ecdartheory}. 
Also, systems may be critical, meaning that their reliability is extremely important. 
To ensure this high level of reliability, it is nessecary to ensure that the system matches its specification.
This is called model checking.
\todo{The definition of model checking}
To illustrate the importance of model checking, consider the following example:

Imagine for a moment that you are working for a space agency and your mission is to send a satellite into space.
You have spent several months testing the satellite to make sure it is correct and everything is working as intended.
All tests have passed for every edge case your engineers could think of.
The satelite is ready and for launch.
The day after launch however, a major problem in the system is found. 
It will need to be fixed if the satelite is to have any use, but doing so might be extremely expensive or outright impossible.

As the model grows in size, it becomes ever more complex to verify by hand.
The immense complexity of modern systems dictates that the verification must be computer aided in order to be feasible \cite{modelchecking_handbook}. ECDAR is one such tool

ECDAR currently combines a graphical user interface for modelling real-time systems using timed input/output automata with a model checking engine.

%Also how efficient ECDAR is as a tool is dependent on what kind of algorithms are used, and the efficiency of the run-time.

%%ECDAR therefore tests the correctness of the model using timed I/O automata.
%% It parallelizes test-case generation and test execution to provide this significant speed-up.

%To sum up, what the purpose of ECDAR is:
%\begin{quote}
%"[to integrate] conformance testing into a new IDE that now features modelling, verification, and testing. The new tool uses model-based mutation testing, requiring only the model and the system under test, to locate faults and to prove the absence of certain types of faults." \cite{Gundersen_2018}
