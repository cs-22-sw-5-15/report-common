\subsection{Model Checking in ECDAR}
ECDAR currently combines a graphical user interface for modelling real-time systems using timed input/output automata with a model checking engine. Currently ECDAR has two verification engines: j-ecdar and Reveaal, that is written in java and rust respectively.

ECDAR strive to help check if different models match given a specification. ECDAR will check

%To sum up, what the purpose of ECDAR is:

This section will go over the ECDAR tool, to further illustrate the intent of ECDAR and how far it has been developed. The GUI of ECDAR 2.3.3 can be seen in \autoref{fig:ECDAR-gui}.
