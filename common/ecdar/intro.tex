ECDAR (\textbf{E}nvironment for \textbf{C}ompositional \textbf{D}esign and \textbf{A}nalysis of \textbf{R}eal Time Systems.)
 is a tool for model checking \cite{ecdartheory} which is a form of computer aided varification \cite{modelchecking_handbook}.
Systems nowadays are big and complex and consists of multiple components designed by independent teams \cite{ecdartheory}. 
Also, systems may be critical, meaning that their reliability is extremely important. 
To ensure this high level of reliability, it is nessecary to ensure that the system matches its specification.
This is called model checking.
